### Rocket Delivery

Rocket Delivery is my second personal project since [utility-web](http://utility-web.vercel.app)

##### What is Rocket Delivery? 

Rocket Delivery is my attempt at replicating the functionality of a food delivery mobile application. It is built primarily with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and for styling, I decided to go with the StyleSheet component which comes out of the box with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) since I am an absolute noob at React Native and all things mobile development.

The primary color swatch is coral and the secondary color is grey? I am not sure though. You might notice some inconsistencies that expose my flaw when it comes to designing systems.

Also, I am using expo. it seems like it is the most popular toolchain for building react native. That tool is a 10/10.
